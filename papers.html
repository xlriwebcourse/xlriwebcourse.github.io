						<h3>What is the Blockchain?</h3>
						<p>The Blockchain is often referred to as a distributed cryptographic database.
The database, also called a ledger, is maintained by a network of
computers. The ledger makes it possible for the entire network to create, evolve
and keep track of an immutable record of transactions. The most successful
blockchain application thus far has been Bitcoin, which was outlined in the seminal paper, “Bitcoin: A Peer-
to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008. This powerful technology has so far
been been implicated in the numerous unregulated cyrptocurrencies that exist
online. Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential
applications of blockchains in conventionally regulated industries.</p>

								<h3>Paper 1: Digital Currency</h3>
								<p>The blockchain is made up of different technologies derived from different fields
of computer science. Consensus mechanisms are derived from computer net-
working. Cryptographic security is derived from information theory. The wallet,
or where the user interacts with his tokens, lives on different devices including
smartphones. In some paradigms it can be useful to think of the blockchain as
a protocol that can be implemented over existing networking infrastructure, the
internet being the most important. The blockchain industry must work towards
standardization of internal components. This standardization will involve large
established firms, like IBM, creating consensus mechanism standards, a smart
contract core upon which derived contracts will be written, database implemen-
tation on which the ledger is built, and cryptographic security.<br></br> Read more by downloading the pdf.</p>

								<h3>Paper 2: Smart Contracts</h3>
								<p>Contracts are essentially agreements between two parties that contain precise
rules about what actions are to be undertaken by whom and under which cir-
cumstances. To establish trust between such two parties, a number of insti-
tutions facilitate transactions. Most financial industries are heavily dependent
on such ’middle men’. The blockchain provides a trustless mechanism that can
automate contracts. Automation of contracts would include immutability with
respect to the contract rules. Once the contract rules have been agreed upon,
neither party can change rules or renege on them. It also includes using third
party sources to ascertain if conditions dependent on external factors have been
met. Making middle men obsolete also carries with it the added advantage of
reduced settlement times as well as reduced operational costs.<br></br> Read more by downloading the pdf.</p>
